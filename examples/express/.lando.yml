# Express server example
name: express

# Give me http://express.lndo.site and https://express.lndo.site
proxy:
  appserver:
    - express.lndo.site

# Spin up services to run a basic node server
services:

  # Create a node instance
  appserver:

    # Node version 6.10
    type: node:6.10

    # Optionally create certs in /certs that can be used by your application
    # to listen over https. Creates the following certs your app can use
    #
    #   - /certs/cert.key
    #   - /certs/cert.crt
    #   - /certs/cert.pem
    #
    ssl: true

    # Optionally install the following npm dependencies globally
    # These follow the normal package.json form
    #
    # Note that most deps should be installed by the normal npm install, this is
    # for things like gulp/grunt cli that are global dependencies
    globals:
      gulp-cli: "latest"

    # Optionally specify a command to run when you start your node service up.
    #
    # If you are using node as a server you are going to want to define this.
    # This can be either a string or array.
    #
    # If you are just spinning up a node container to run front end dependencies
    # you can leave this blank and the container will boot up and stay on
    #
    # You will likely want to run `lando npm install` first so needed dependencies are
    # installed before your server starts up.
    #
    command: npm start

    # Install some extra server packages
    # run_as_root:
    #  - "apt-get update -y"
    #  - "apt-get install vim -y"

    # Print a message just to demonstrate this
    # run:
    # - "cd $LANDO_MOUNT & echo 'Holla!'"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:

  # Any node service with a defined command (aka not running in cli only mode)
  # Will also spin up a node cli container called `SERVICENAME_cli` (appserver_cli)
  # in this example.
  #
  # This will allow you to run things like `lando npm install` without needing
  # to `lando start` first. This is particularly needed for node based projects
  # since you almost always need to run `npm install` before you can boot up your
  # app successfully.
  npm:
    service: appserver_cli
  node:
    service: appserver_cli
  yarn:
    service: appserver_cli

  # This should be available ONLY AFTER you start up the app since it gets installed
  # globally in the `globals` key in the appserver definition above
  gulp:
    service: appserver

  # Extra commands for fun
  vim:
    service: appserver
