# Redis example
name: redis

#
# You need to run `lando npm install` before you run `lando start` for this
# example to work
#

# Give me http://redis.lndo.site
proxy:
  appserver:
    - redis.lndo.site

# Spin up a basic nodes server with redis backend
services:

  # Spin up a redis container called "cache"
  # NOTE: "cache" is arbitrary, you could just as well call this "theboss" or "eljefe"
  cache:

    # Use version 3.2 of redis
    type: redis:3.2

    # Optionally allow access to the cache at localhost:6380
    # You will need to make sure port 6380 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 6380

    # Optionally set the redis cache to persist
    persist: true

    # Optionally load in a custom redis.conf this is relative to your app root
    # directory
    # config:
    #  config: config/redis.conf

  # Spin up services to run a basic node server
  appserver:
    type: node:6.10
    command: npm start
    # run:
    #  - "cd $LANDO_MOUNT & npm install"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:
  # Drop the user into a redis shell
  redis-cli:
    service: cache
  npm:
    service: appserver_cli
  node:
    service: appserver_cli
