ABOUT STARK
-----------

The Stark theme is provided for demonstration purposes; it uses Drupal's default
HTML markup and CSS styles. It can be used as a troubleshooting tool to
determine whether module-related CSS and JavaScript are interfering with a more
complex theme, and can be used by designers interested in studying Drupal's
default markup without the interference of changes commonly made by more complex
themes.

To avoid obscuring CSS added to the page by Drupal or a contrib module, the
Stark theme itself has no styling, except just enough CSS to arrange the page in
a traditional "Header, sidebars, content, and footer" layout. See the layout.css
file for more information.
