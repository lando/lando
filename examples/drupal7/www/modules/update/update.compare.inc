 * that logic is only required when preparing the status report, not for
 * fetching the available release data.
 *
 * This array is fairly expensive to construct, since it involves a lot of disk
 * I/O, so we cache the results into the {cache_update} table using the
 * 'update_project_projects' cache ID. However, since this is not the data about
 * available updates fetched from the network, it is acceptable to invalidate it

 * more likely to see incorrect results if they upgrade to a newer version of a
 * module or theme but do not visit certain pages that automatically clear this

 *     - package: The package that the project is grouped under.
 *     - version: The version of the project.
 *     - project: The Drupal.org project name.

 *   - datestamp: The date stamp when the project was released, if known.
 *   - includes: An associative array containing all projects included with this
 *     project, keyed by the machine-readable short name with the human-readable
 *     name as value.
 *   - project_type: The type of project. Allowed values are 'module' and
 *     'theme'.
 *   - project_status: This indicates if the project is enabled and will always
 *     be TRUE, as the function only returns enabled projects.
 *   - sub_themes: If the project is a theme it contains an associative array of

/**
 * Calculates the current update status of a specific project.
 *
 * This function is the heart of the update status feature. For each project it
 * is invoked with, it first checks if the project has been flagged with a
 * special status like "unsupported" or "insecure", or if the project node
 * itself has been unpublished. In any of those cases, the project is marked
 * with an error and the next project is considered.
 *
 * If the project itself is valid, the function decides what major release
 * series to consider. The project defines what the currently supported major
 * versions are for each version of core, so the first step is to make sure the
 * current version is still supported. If so, that's the target version. If the
 * current version is unsupported, the project maintainer's recommended major
 * version is used. There's also a check to make sure that this function never
 * recommends an earlier release than the currently installed major version.
 *
 * Given a target major version, the available releases are scanned looking for
 * the specific release to recommend (avoiding beta releases and development
 * snapshots if possible). For the target major version, the highest patch level
 * is found. If there is a release at that patch level with no extra ("beta",
 * etc.), then the release at that patch level with the most recent release date
 * is recommended. If every release at that patch level has extra (only betas),
 * then the latest release from the previous patch level is recommended. For
 * example:
 *
 * - 1.6-bugfix <-- recommended version because 1.6 already exists.
 * - 1.6
 *
 * or
 *
 * - 1.6-beta
 * - 1.5 <-- recommended version because no 1.6 exists.
 * - 1.4
 *
 * Also, the latest release from the same major version is looked for, even beta
 * releases, to display to the user as the "Latest version" option.
 * Additionally, the latest official release from any higher major versions that
 * have been released is searched for to provide a set of "Also available"
 * options.
 *
 * Finally, and most importantly, the release history continues to be scanned
 * until the currently installed release is reached, searching for anything
 * marked as a security update. If any security updates have been found between
 * the recommended release and the installed version, all of the releases that
 * included a security fix are recorded so that the site administrator can be
 * warned their site is insecure, and links pointing to the release notes for
 * each security update can be included (which, in turn, will link to the
 * official security announcements for each vulnerability).
 *
 * This function relies on the fact that the .xml release history data comes
 * sorted based on major version and patch level, then finally by release date
 * if there are multiple releases such as betas from the same major.patch
 * version (e.g., 5.x-1.5-beta1, 5.x-1.5-beta2, and 5.x-1.5). Development
 * snapshots for a given major version are always listed last.

 * These two arrays are cached in the {cache_update} table and used whenever

 * report, available updates report, or the module or theme administration
 * pages, since we should always recompute the most current values on any of

 * I/O and some fairly heavy CPU processing), neither of these is the actual
 * data about available updates that we have to fetch over the network from
 * updates.drupal.org. That information is stored with the
 * 'update_available_releases' cache ID -- it needs to persist longer than 1
 * hour and never get invalidated just by visiting a page on the site.
