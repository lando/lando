 * The condition is built exactly like SelectQuery or UpdateQuery conditions,
 * the UPDATE query part is built similarly like an UpdateQuery and finally the

 * UpdateQuery and InsertQuery has a fields method so

 * wrapper is MergeQuery::key() which adds the same column-value pairs to the

 * Several methods (key(), fields(), insertFields()) can be called to set a
