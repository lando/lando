/**
 * @defgroup form_api Form generation
 * @{
 * Functions to enable the processing and display of HTML forms.
 *
 * Drupal uses these functions to achieve consistency in its form processing and
 * presentation, while simplifying code and reducing the amount of HTML that
 * must be explicitly generated by modules.
 *
 * The primary function used with forms is drupal_get_form(), which is
 * used for forms presented interactively to a user. Forms can also be built and
 * submitted programmatically without any user input using the
 * drupal_form_submit() function.
 *
 * drupal_get_form() handles retrieving, processing, and displaying a rendered
 * HTML form for modules automatically.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to use drupal_get_form() and a form builder
 * function:
 * @code
 * $form = drupal_get_form('my_module_example_form');
 * ...
 * function my_module_example_form($form, &$form_state) {
 *   $form['submit'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'submit',
 *     '#value' => t('Submit'),
 *   );
 *   return $form;
 * }
 * function my_module_example_form_validate($form, &$form_state) {
 *   // Validation logic.
 * }
 * function my_module_example_form_submit($form, &$form_state) {
 *   // Submission logic.
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Or with any number of additional arguments:
 * @code
 * $extra = "extra";
 * $form = drupal_get_form('my_module_example_form', $extra);
 * ...
 * function my_module_example_form($form, &$form_state, $extra) {
 *   $form['submit'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'submit',
 *     '#value' => $extra,
 *   );
 *   return $form;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The $form argument to form-related functions is a structured array containing
 * the elements and properties of the form. For information on the array
 * components and format, and more detailed explanations of the Form API
 * workflow, see the
 * @link forms_api_reference.html Form API reference @endlink
 * and the
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/37775 Form API documentation section. @endlink
 * In addition, there is a set of Form API tutorials in
 * @link form_example_tutorial.inc the Form Example Tutorial @endlink which
 * provide basics all the way up through multistep forms.
 *
 * In the form builder, validation, submission, and other form functions,
 * $form_state is the primary influence on the processing of the form and is
 * passed by reference to most functions, so they use it to communicate with
 * the form system and each other.
 *
 * See drupal_build_form() for documentation of $form_state keys.

/**
 * Builds and process a form based on a form id.
 *
 * The form may also be retrieved from the cache if the form was built in a
 * previous page-load. The form is then passed on for processing, validation
 * and submission if there is proper input.
 *
 * @param $form_id
 *   The unique string identifying the desired form. If a function with that
 *   name exists, it is called to build the form array. Modules that need to
 *   generate the same form (or very similar forms) using different $form_ids
 *   can implement hook_forms(), which maps different $form_id values to the
 *   proper form constructor function. Examples may be found in node_forms(),
 *   and search_forms().
 * @param $form_state
 *   An array which stores information about the form. This is passed as a
 *   reference so that the caller can use it to examine what in the form changed
 *   when the form submission process is complete. Furthermore, it may be used
 *   to store information related to the processed data in the form, which will
 *   persist across page requests when the 'cache' or 'rebuild' flag is set.
 *   The following parameters may be set in $form_state to affect how the form
 *   is rendered:
 *   - build_info: Internal. An associative array of information stored by Form
 *     API that is necessary to build and rebuild the form from cache when the
 *     original context may no longer be available:
 *     - args: A list of arguments to pass to the form constructor.
 *     - files: An optional array defining include files that need to be loaded
 *       for building the form. Each array entry may be the path to a file or
 *       another array containing values for the parameters 'type', 'module' and
 *       'name' as needed by module_load_include(). The files listed here are
 *       automatically loaded by form_get_cache(). By default the current menu
 *       router item's 'file' definition is added, if any. Use
 *       form_load_include() to add include files from a form constructor.
 *     - form_id: Identification of the primary form being constructed and
 *       processed.
 *     - base_form_id: Identification for a base form, as declared in a
 *       hook_forms() implementation.
 *     - immutable: If this flag is set to TRUE, a new form build id is
 *       generated when the form is loaded from the cache. If it is subsequently
 *       saved to the cache again, it will have another cache id and therefore
 *       the original form and form-state will remain unaltered. This is
 *       important when page caching is enabled in order to prevent form state
 *       from leaking between anonymous users.
 *   - rebuild_info: Internal. Similar to 'build_info', but pertaining to
 *     drupal_rebuild_form().
 *   - rebuild: Normally, after the entire form processing is completed and
 *     submit handlers have run, a form is considered to be done and
 *     drupal_redirect_form() will redirect the user to a new page using a GET
 *     request (so a browser refresh does not re-submit the form). However, if
 *     'rebuild' has been set to TRUE, then a new copy of the form is
 *     immediately built and sent to the browser, instead of a redirect. This is
 *     used for multi-step forms, such as wizards and confirmation forms.
 *     Normally, $form_state['rebuild'] is set by a submit handler, since it is
 *     usually logic within a submit handler that determines whether a form is
 *     done or requires another step. However, a validation handler may already
 *     set $form_state['rebuild'] to cause the form processing to bypass submit
 *     handlers and rebuild the form instead, even if there are no validation
 *     errors.
 *   - redirect: Used to redirect the form on submission. It may either be a
 *     string containing the destination URL, or an array of arguments
 *     compatible with drupal_goto(). See drupal_redirect_form() for complete
 *     information.
 *   - no_redirect: If set to TRUE the form will NOT perform a drupal_goto(),
 *     even if 'redirect' is set.
 *   - method: The HTTP form method to use for finding the input for this form.
 *     May be 'post' or 'get'. Defaults to 'post'. Note that 'get' method
 *     forms do not use form ids so are always considered to be submitted, which
 *     can have unexpected effects. The 'get' method should only be used on
 *     forms that do not change data, as that is exclusively the domain of
 *     'post.'
 *   - cache: If set to TRUE the original, unprocessed form structure will be
 *     cached, which allows the entire form to be rebuilt from cache. A typical
 *     form workflow involves two page requests; first, a form is built and
 *     rendered for the user to fill in. Then, the user fills the form in and
 *     submits it, triggering a second page request in which the form must be
 *     built and processed. By default, $form and $form_state are built from
 *     scratch during each of these page requests. Often, it is necessary or
 *     desired to persist the $form and $form_state variables from the initial
 *     page request to the one that processes the submission. 'cache' can be set
 *     to TRUE to do this. A prominent example is an Ajax-enabled form, in which
 *     ajax_process_form() enables form caching for all forms that include an
 *     element with the #ajax property. (The Ajax handler has no way to build
 *     the form itself, so must rely on the cached version.) Note that the
 *     persistence of $form and $form_state happens automatically for
 *     (multi-step) forms having the 'rebuild' flag set, regardless of the value
 *     for 'cache'.
 *   - no_cache: If set to TRUE the form will NOT be cached, even if 'cache' is
 *     set.
 *   - values: An associative array of values submitted to the form. The
 *     validation functions and submit functions use this array for nearly all
 *     their decision making. (Note that #tree determines whether the values are
 *     a flat array or an array whose structure parallels the $form array. See
 *     @link forms_api_reference.html Form API reference @endlink for more
 *     information.) These are raw and unvalidated, so should not be used
 *     without a thorough understanding of security implications. In almost all
 *     cases, code should use the data in the 'values' array exclusively. The
 *     most common use of this key is for multi-step forms that need to clear
 *     some of the user input when setting 'rebuild'. The values correspond to
 *     $_POST or $_GET, depending on the 'method' chosen.
 *   - always_process: If TRUE and the method is GET, a form_id is not
 *     necessary. This should only be used on RESTful GET forms that do NOT
 *     write data, as this could lead to security issues. It is useful so that
 *     searches do not need to have a form_id in their query arguments to
 *     trigger the search.
 *   - must_validate: Ordinarily, a form is only validated once, but there are
 *     times when a form is resubmitted internally and should be validated
 *     again. Setting this to TRUE will force that to happen. This is most
 *     likely to occur during Ajax operations.
 *   - programmed: If TRUE, the form was submitted programmatically, usually
 *     invoked via drupal_form_submit(). Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - programmed_bypass_access_check: If TRUE, programmatic form submissions
 *     are processed without taking #access into account. Set this to FALSE
 *     when submitting a form programmatically with values that may have been
 *     input by the user executing the current request; this will cause #access
 *     to be respected as it would on a normal form submission. Defaults to
 *     TRUE.
 *   - process_input: Boolean flag. TRUE signifies correct form submission.
 *     This is always TRUE for programmed forms coming from drupal_form_submit()
 *     (see 'programmed' key), or if the form_id coming from the $_POST data is
 *     set and matches the current form_id.
 *   - submitted: If TRUE, the form has been submitted. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - executed: If TRUE, the form was submitted and has been processed and
 *     executed. Defaults to FALSE.
 *   - triggering_element: (read-only) The form element that triggered
 *     submission. This is the same as the deprecated
 *     $form_state['clicked_button']. It is the element that caused submission,
 *     which may or may not be a button (in the case of Ajax forms). This key is
 *     often used to distinguish between various buttons in a submit handler,
 *     and is also used in Ajax handlers.
 *   - clicked_button: Deprecated. Use triggering_element instead.
 *   - has_file_element: Internal. If TRUE, there is a file element and Form API
 *     will set the appropriate 'enctype' HTML attribute on the form.
 *   - groups: Internal. An array containing references to fieldsets to render
 *     them within vertical tabs.
 *   - storage: $form_state['storage'] is not a special key, and no specific
 *     support is provided for it in the Form API. By tradition it was
 *     the location where application-specific data was stored for communication
 *     between the submit, validation, and form builder functions, especially
 *     in a multi-step-style form. Form implementations may use any key(s)
 *     within $form_state (other than the keys listed here and other reserved
 *     ones used by Form API internals) for this kind of storage. The
 *     recommended way to ensure that the chosen key doesn't conflict with ones
 *     used by the Form API or other modules is to use the module name as the
 *     key name or a prefix for the key name. For example, the Node module uses
 *     $form_state['node'] in node editing forms to store information about the
 *     node being edited, and this information stays available across successive
 *     clicks of the "Preview" button as well as when the "Save" button is
 *     finally clicked.
 *   - buttons: A list containing copies of all submit and button elements in
 *     the form.
 *   - complete form: A reference to the $form variable containing the complete
 *     form structure. #process, #after_build, #element_validate, and other
 *     handlers being invoked on a form element may use this reference to access
 *     other information in the form the element is contained in.
 *   - temporary: An array holding temporary data accessible during the current
 *     page request only. All $form_state properties that are not reserved keys
 *     (see form_state_keys_no_cache()) persist throughout a multistep form
 *     sequence. Form API provides this key for modules to communicate
 *     information across form-related functions during a single page request.
 *     It may be used to temporarily save data that does not need to or should
 *     not be cached during the whole form workflow; e.g., data that needs to be
 *     accessed during the current form build process only. There is no use-case
 *     for this functionality in Drupal core.
 *   - wrapper_callback: Modules that wish to pre-populate certain forms with
 *     common elements, such as back/next/save buttons in multi-step form
 *     wizards, may define a form builder function name that returns a form
 *     structure, which is passed on to the actual form builder function.
 *     Such implementations may either define the 'wrapper_callback' via
 *     hook_forms() or have to invoke drupal_build_form() (instead of
 *     drupal_get_form()) on their own in a custom menu callback to prepare
 *     $form_state accordingly.
 *   Information on how certain $form_state properties control redirection
 *   behavior after form submission may be found in drupal_redirect_form().
 *
 * @return
 *   The rendered form. This function may also perform a redirect and hence may
 *   not return at all, depending upon the $form_state flags that were set.
 *
 * @see drupal_redirect_form()

 *
 * There is no return value, but you can check to see if there are errors

 *   Modules that need to generate the same form (or very similar forms)
 *   using different $form_ids can implement hook_forms(), which maps
 *   different $form_id values to the proper form constructor function. Examples
 *   may be found in node_forms() and search_forms().
 * @param $form_state
 *   A keyed array containing the current state of the form. Most important is
 *   the $form_state['values'] collection, a tree of data used to simulate the
 *   incoming $_POST information from a user's form submission. If a key is not
 *   filled in $form_state['values'], then the default value of the respective
 *   element is used. To submit an unchecked checkbox or other control that

 * @param ...
 *   Any additional arguments are passed on to the functions called by
 *   drupal_form_submit(), including the unique form constructor function.
 *   For example, the node_edit form requires that a node object be passed
 *   in here when it is called. Arguments that need to be passed by reference
 *   should not be included here, but rather placed directly in the $form_state
 *   build info array so that the reference can be preserved. For example, a
 *   form builder function with the following signature:
 *   @code
 *   function mymodule_form($form, &$form_state, &$object) {
 *   }
 *   @endcode

 *   $form_state['values'] = $my_form_values;
 *   $form_state['build_info']['args'] = array(&$object);
 *   drupal_form_submit('mymodule_form', $form_state);
 *   @endcode
 * For example:
 * @code
 * // register a new user
 * $form_state = array();
 * $form_state['values']['name'] = 'robo-user';
 * $form_state['values']['mail'] = 'robouser@example.com';
 * $form_state['values']['pass']['pass1'] = 'password';

/**
 * Redirects the user to a URL after a form has been processed.
 *
 * After a form is submitted and processed, normally the user should be
 * redirected to a new destination page. This function figures out what that
 * destination should be, based on the $form_state array and the 'destination'
 * query string in the request URL, and redirects the user there.
 *
 * Usually (for exceptions, see below) $form_state['redirect'] determines where
 * to redirect the user. This can be set either to a string (the path to
 * redirect to), or an array of arguments for drupal_goto(). If
 * $form_state['redirect'] is missing, the user is usually (again, see below for
 * exceptions) redirected back to the page they came from, where they should see
 * a fresh, unpopulated copy of the form.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to set up a form to redirect to the path 'node':
 * @code
 * $form_state['redirect'] = 'node';
 * @endcode
 * And here is an example of how to redirect to 'node/123?foo=bar#baz':
 * @code
 * $form_state['redirect'] = array(
 *   'node/123',
 *   array(
 *     'query' => array(
 *       'foo' => 'bar',
 *     ),
 *     'fragment' => 'baz',
 *   ),
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * There are several exceptions to the "usual" behavior described above:
 * - If $form_state['programmed'] is TRUE, the form submission was usually
 *   invoked via drupal_form_submit(), so any redirection would break the script
 *   that invoked drupal_form_submit() and no redirection is done.
 * - If $form_state['rebuild'] is TRUE, the form is being rebuilt, and no
 *   redirection is done.
 * - If $form_state['no_redirect'] is TRUE, redirection is disabled. This is
 *   set, for instance, by ajax_get_form() to prevent redirection in Ajax
 *   callbacks. $form_state['no_redirect'] should never be set or altered by
 *   form builder functions or form validation/submit handlers.
 * - If $form_state['redirect'] is set to FALSE, redirection is disabled.
 * - If none of the above conditions has prevented redirection, then the
 *   redirect is accomplished by calling drupal_goto(), passing in the value of
 *   $form_state['redirect'] if it is set, or the current path if it is
 *   not. drupal_goto() preferentially uses the value of $_GET['destination']
 *   (the 'destination' URL query string) if it is present, so this will
 *   override any values set by $form_state['redirect']. Note that during
 *   installation, install_goto() is called in place of drupal_goto().

/**
 * Files an error against a form element.
 *
 * When a validation error is detected, the validator calls form_set_error() to
 * indicate which element needs to be changed and provide an error message. This
 * causes the Form API to not execute the form submit handlers, and instead to
 * re-display the form to the user with the corresponding elements rendered with
 * an 'error' CSS class (shown as red by default).
 *
 * The standard form_set_error() behavior can be changed if a button provides
 * the #limit_validation_errors property. Multistep forms not wanting to
 * validate the whole form can set #limit_validation_errors on buttons to
 * limit validation errors to only certain elements. For example, pressing the
 * "Previous" button in a multistep form should not fire validation errors just
 * because the current step has invalid values. If #limit_validation_errors is
 * set on a clicked button, the button must also define a #submit property
 * (may be set to an empty array). Any #submit handlers will be executed even if
 * there is invalid input, so extreme care should be taken with respect to any
 * actions taken by them. This is typically not a problem with buttons like
 * "Previous" or "Add more" that do not invoke persistent storage of the
 * submitted form values. Do not use the #limit_validation_errors property on
 * buttons that trigger saving of form values to the database.
 *
 * The #limit_validation_errors property is a list of "sections" within
 * $form_state['values'] that must contain valid values. Each "section" is an
 * array with the ordered set of keys needed to reach that part of
 * $form_state['values'] (i.e., the #parents property of the element).
 *
 * Example 1: Allow the "Previous" button to function, regardless of whether any
 * user input is valid.
 *
 * @code
 *   $form['actions']['previous'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'submit',
 *     '#value' => t('Previous'),
 *     '#limit_validation_errors' => array(),       // No validation.
 *     '#submit' => array('some_submit_function'),  // #submit required.
 *   );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example 2: Require some, but not all, user input to be valid to process the
 * submission of a "Previous" button.
 *
 * @code
 *   $form['actions']['previous'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'submit',
 *     '#value' => t('Previous'),
 *     '#limit_validation_errors' => array(
 *       array('step1'),       // Validate $form_state['values']['step1'].
 *       array('foo', 'bar'),  // Validate $form_state['values']['foo']['bar'].
 *     ),
 *     '#submit' => array('some_submit_function'), // #submit required.
 *   );
 * @endcode
 *
 * This will require $form_state['values']['step1'] and everything within it
 * (for example, $form_state['values']['step1']['choice']) to be valid, so
 * calls to form_set_error('step1', $message) or
 * form_set_error('step1][choice', $message) will prevent the submit handlers
 * from running, and result in the error message being displayed to the user.
 * However, calls to form_set_error('step2', $message) and
 * form_set_error('step2][groupX][choiceY', $message) will be suppressed,
 * resulting in the message not being displayed to the user, and the submit
 * handlers will run despite $form_state['values']['step2'] and
 * $form_state['values']['step2']['groupX']['choiceY'] containing invalid
 * values. Errors for an invalid $form_state['values']['foo'] will be
 * suppressed, but errors flagging invalid values for
 * $form_state['values']['foo']['bar'] and everything within it will be
 * flagged and submission prevented.
 *
 * Partial form validation is implemented by suppressing errors rather than by
 * skipping the input processing and validation steps entirely, because some
 * forms have button-level submit handlers that call Drupal API functions that
 * assume that certain data exists within $form_state['values'], and while not
 * doing anything with that data that requires it to be valid, PHP errors
 * would be triggered if the input processing and validation steps were fully
 * skipped.

/**
 * Builds and processes all elements in the structured form array.
 *
 * Adds any required properties to each element, maps the incoming input data
 * to the proper elements, and executes any #process handlers attached to a
 * specific element.
 *
 * This is one of the three primary functions that recursively iterates a form
 * array. This one does it for completing the form building process. The other
 * two are _form_validate() (invoked via drupal_validate_form() and used to
 * invoke validation logic for each element) and drupal_render() (for rendering
 * each element). Each of these three pipelines provides ample opportunity for
 * modules to customize what happens. For example, during this function's life
 * cycle, the following functions get called for each element:
 * - $element['#value_callback']: A function that implements how user input is
 *   mapped to an element's #value property. This defaults to a function named
 *   'form_type_TYPE_value' where TYPE is $element['#type'].
 * - $element['#process']: An array of functions called after user input has
 *   been mapped to the element's #value property. These functions can be used
 *   to dynamically add child elements: for example, for the 'date' element
 *   type, one of the functions in this array is form_process_date(), which adds
 *   the individual 'year', 'month', 'day', etc. child elements. These functions
 *   can also be used to set additional properties or implement special logic
 *   other than adding child elements: for example, for the 'fieldset' element
 *   type, one of the functions in this array is form_process_fieldset(), which
 *   adds the attributes and JavaScript needed to make the fieldset collapsible
 *   if the #collapsible property is set. The #process functions are called in
 *   preorder traversal, meaning they are called for the parent element first,
 *   then for the child elements.
 * - $element['#after_build']: An array of functions called after form_builder()
 *   is done with its processing of the element. These are called in postorder
 *   traversal, meaning they are called for the child elements first, then for
 *   the parent element.
 * There are similar properties containing callback functions invoked by
 * _form_validate() and drupal_render(), appropriate for those operations.
 *
 * Developers are strongly encouraged to integrate the functionality needed by
 * their form or module within one of these three pipelines, using the
 * appropriate callback property, rather than implementing their own recursive
 * traversal of a form array. This facilitates proper integration between
 * multiple modules. For example, module developers are familiar with the
 * relative order in which hook_form_alter() implementations and #process
 * functions run. A custom traversal function that affects the building of a
 * form is likely to not integrate with hook_form_alter() and #process in the
 * expected way. Also, deep recursion within PHP is both slow and memory
 * intensive, so it is best to minimize how often it's done.
 *
 * As stated above, each element's #process functions are executed after its
 * #value has been set. This enables those functions to execute conditional
 * logic based on the current value. However, all of form_builder() runs before
 * drupal_validate_form() is called, so during #process function execution, the
 * element's #value has not yet been validated, so any code that requires
 * validated values must reside within a submit handler.
 *
 * As a security measure, user input is used for an element's #value only if the
 * element exists within $form, is not disabled (as per the #disabled property),
 * and can be accessed (as per the #access property, except that forms submitted
 * using drupal_form_submit() bypass #access restrictions). When user input is
 * ignored due to #disabled and #access restrictions, the element's default
 * value is used.
 *
 * Because of the preorder traversal, where #process functions of an element run
 * before user input for its child elements is processed, and because of the
 * Form API security of user input processing with respect to #access and
 * #disabled described above, this generally means that #process functions
 * should not use an element's (unvalidated) #value to affect the #disabled or
 * #access of child elements. Use-cases where a developer may be tempted to
 * implement such conditional logic usually fall into one of two categories:
 * - Where user input from the current submission must affect the structure of a
 *   form, including properties like #access and #disabled that affect how the
 *   next submission needs to be processed, a multi-step workflow is needed.
 *   This is most commonly implemented with a submit handler setting persistent
 *   data within $form_state based on *validated* values in
 *   $form_state['values'] and setting $form_state['rebuild']. The form building
 *   functions must then be implemented to use the $form_state data to rebuild
 *   the form with the structure appropriate for the new state.
 * - Where user input must affect the rendering of the form without affecting
 *   its structure, the necessary conditional rendering logic should reside
 *   within functions that run during the rendering phase (#pre_render, #theme,
 *   #theme_wrappers, and #post_render).
 *
 * @param $form_id
 *   A unique string identifying the form for validation, submission,
 *   theming, and hook_form_alter functions.
 * @param $element
 *   An associative array containing the structure of the current element.
 * @param $form_state
 *   A keyed array containing the current state of the form. In this
 *   context, it is used to accumulate information about which button
 *   was clicked when the form was submitted, as well as the sanitized
 *   $_POST data.

 *     - A string or integer key whose value is a translated string is
 *       interpreted as a single HTML option element. Do not use placeholders
 *       that sanitize data: doing so will lead to double-escaping. Note that
 *       the key will be visible in the HTML and could be modified by malicious
 *       users, so don't put sensitive information in it.
 *     - A translated string key whose value is an array indicates a group of
 *       options. The translated string is used as the label attribute for the
 *       optgroup. Do not use placeholders to sanitize data: doing so will lead
 *       to double-escaping. The array should contain the options you wish to
 *       group and should follow the syntax of $element['#options'].
 *     - If the function encounters a string or integer key whose value is an
 *       object with an 'option' property, the key is ignored, the contents of
 *       the option property are interpreted as $element['#options'], and the
 *       resulting HTML is added to the output.
 *   - #value: Optional integer, string, or array representing which option(s)
 *     to pre-select when the list is first displayed. The integer or string
 *     must match the key of an option in the '#options' list. If '#multiple' is
 *     TRUE, this can be an array of integers or strings.

/**
 * Returns HTML for a form element.
 *
 * Each form element is wrapped in a DIV container having the following CSS
 * classes:
 * - form-item: Generic for all form elements.
 * - form-type-#type: The internal element #type.
 * - form-item-#name: The internal form element #name (usually derived from the
 *   $form structure and set via form_builder()).
 * - form-disabled: Only set if the form element is #disabled.
 *
 * In addition to the element itself, the DIV contains a label for the element
 * based on the optional #title_display property, and an optional #description.
 *
 * The optional #title_display property can have these values:
 * - before: The label is output before the element. This is the default.
 *   The label includes the #title and the required marker, if #required.
 * - after: The label is output after the element. For example, this is used
 *   for radio and checkbox #type elements as set in system_element_info().
 *   If the #title is empty but the field is #required, the label will
 *   contain only the required marker.
 * - invisible: Labels are critical for screen readers to enable them to
 *   properly navigate through forms but can be visually distracting. This
 *   property hides the label for everyone except screen readers.
 * - attribute: Set the title attribute on the element to create a tooltip
 *   but output no label element. This is supported only for checkboxes
 *   and radios in form_pre_render_conditional_form_element(). It is used
 *   where a visual label is not needed, such as a table of checkboxes where
 *   the row and column provide the context. The tooltip will include the
 *   title and required marker.
 *
 * If the #title property is not set, then the label and any required marker
 * will not be output, regardless of the #title_display or #required values.
 * This can be useful in cases such as the password_confirm element, which
 * creates children elements that have their own labels and required markers,
 * but the parent element should have neither. Use this carefully because a
 * field without an associated label can cause accessibility challenges.

/**
 * @defgroup batch Batch operations
 * @{
 * Creates and processes batch operations.
 *
 * Functions allowing forms processing to be spread out over several page
 * requests, thus ensuring that the processing does not get interrupted
 * because of a PHP timeout, while allowing the user to receive feedback
 * on the progress of the ongoing operations.
 *
 * The API is primarily designed to integrate nicely with the Form API
 * workflow, but can also be used by non-Form API scripts (like update.php)
 * or even simple page callbacks (which should probably be used sparingly).
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * $batch = array(
 *   'title' => t('Exporting'),
 *   'operations' => array(
 *     array('my_function_1', array($account->uid, 'story')),
 *     array('my_function_2', array()),
 *   ),
 *   'finished' => 'my_finished_callback',
 *   'file' => 'path_to_file_containing_myfunctions',
 * );
 * batch_set($batch);
 * // Only needed if not inside a form _submit handler.
 * // Setting redirect in batch_process.
 * batch_process('node/1');
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note: if the batch 'title', 'init_message', 'progress_message', or
 * 'error_message' could contain any user input, it is the responsibility of
 * the code calling batch_set() to sanitize them first with a function like
 * check_plain() or filter_xss(). Furthermore, if the batch operation
 * returns any user input in the 'results' or 'message' keys of $context,
 * it must also sanitize them first.
 *
 * Sample callback_batch_operation():
 * @code
 * // Simple and artificial: load a node of a given type for a given user
 * function my_function_1($uid, $type, &$context) {
 *   // The $context array gathers batch context information about the execution (read),
 *   // as well as 'return values' for the current operation (write)
 *   // The following keys are provided :
 *   // 'results' (read / write): The array of results gathered so far by
 *   //   the batch processing, for the current operation to append its own.
 *   // 'message' (write): A text message displayed in the progress page.
 *   // The following keys allow for multi-step operations :
 *   // 'sandbox' (read / write): An array that can be freely used to
 *   //   store persistent data between iterations. It is recommended to
 *   //   use this instead of $_SESSION, which is unsafe if the user
 *   //   continues browsing in a separate window while the batch is processing.
 *   // 'finished' (write): A float number between 0 and 1 informing
 *   //   the processing engine of the completion level for the operation.
 *   //   1 (or no value explicitly set) means the operation is finished
 *   //   and the batch processing can continue to the next operation.
 *
 *   $node = node_load(array('uid' => $uid, 'type' => $type));
 *   $context['results'][] = $node->nid . ' : ' . check_plain($node->title);
 *   $context['message'] = check_plain($node->title);
 * }
 *
 * // More advanced example: multi-step operation - load all nodes, five by five
 * function my_function_2(&$context) {
 *   if (empty($context['sandbox'])) {
 *     $context['sandbox']['progress'] = 0;
 *     $context['sandbox']['current_node'] = 0;
 *     $context['sandbox']['max'] = db_query('SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nid) FROM {node}')->fetchField();
 *   }
 *   $limit = 5;
 *   $result = db_select('node')
 *     ->fields('node', array('nid'))
 *     ->condition('nid', $context['sandbox']['current_node'], '>')
 *     ->orderBy('nid')
 *     ->range(0, $limit)
 *     ->execute();
 *   foreach ($result as $row) {
 *     $node = node_load($row->nid, NULL, TRUE);
 *     $context['results'][] = $node->nid . ' : ' . check_plain($node->title);
 *     $context['sandbox']['progress']++;
 *     $context['sandbox']['current_node'] = $node->nid;
 *     $context['message'] = check_plain($node->title);
 *   }
 *   if ($context['sandbox']['progress'] != $context['sandbox']['max']) {
 *     $context['finished'] = $context['sandbox']['progress'] / $context['sandbox']['max'];
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Sample callback_batch_finished():
 * @code
 * function my_finished_callback($success, $results, $operations) {
 *   // The 'success' parameter means no fatal PHP errors were detected. All
 *   // other error management should be handled using 'results'.
 *   if ($success) {
 *     $message = format_plural(count($results), 'One post processed.', '@count posts processed.');

/**
 * Adds a new batch.
 *
 * Batch operations are added as new batch sets. Batch sets are used to spread
 * processing (primarily, but not exclusively, forms processing) over several
 * page requests. This helps to ensure that the processing is not interrupted
 * due to PHP timeouts, while users are still able to receive feedback on the
 * progress of the ongoing operations. Combining related operations into
 * distinct batch sets provides clean code independence for each batch set,
 * ensuring that two or more batches, submitted independently, can be processed
 * without mutual interference. Each batch set may specify its own set of
 * operations and results, produce its own UI messages, and trigger its own
 * 'finished' callback. Batch sets are processed sequentially, with the progress
 * bar starting afresh for each new set.
 *
 * @param $batch_definition
 *   An associative array defining the batch, with the following elements (all
 *   are optional except as noted):
 *   - operations: (required) Array of operations to be performed, where each
 *     item is an array consisting of the name of an implementation of
 *     callback_batch_operation() and an array of parameter.
 *     Example:
 *     @code
 *     array(
 *       array('callback_batch_operation_1', array($arg1)),
 *       array('callback_batch_operation_2', array($arg2_1, $arg2_2)),
 *     )
 *     @endcode
 *   - title: A safe, translated string to use as the title for the progress
 *     page. Defaults to t('Processing').
 *   - init_message: Message displayed while the processing is initialized.
 *     Defaults to t('Initializing.').
 *   - progress_message: Message displayed while processing the batch. Available
 *     placeholders are @current, @remaining, @total, @percentage, @estimate and
 *     @elapsed. Defaults to t('Completed @current of @total.').
 *   - error_message: Message displayed if an error occurred while processing
 *     the batch. Defaults to t('An error has occurred.').
 *   - finished: Name of an implementation of callback_batch_finished(). This is
 *     executed after the batch has completed. This should be used to perform
 *     any result massaging that may be needed, and possibly save data in
 *     $_SESSION for display after final page redirection.
 *   - file: Path to the file containing the definitions of the 'operations' and
 *     'finished' functions, for instance if they don't reside in the main
 *     .module file. The path should be relative to base_path(), and thus should
 *     be built using drupal_get_path().

 *     the batch.
