SQLITE REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

To use SQLite with your Drupal installation, the following requirements must be
met: Server has PHP 5.2 or later with PDO, and the PDO SQLite driver must be
enabled.

SQLITE DATABASE CREATION
------------------------

The Drupal installer will create the SQLite database for you. The only
requirement is that the installer must have write permissions to the directory
where the database file resides. This directory (not just the database file) also
has to remain writeable by the web server going forward for SQLite to continue to
be able to operate.

On the "Database configuration" form in the "Database file" field, you must
supply the exact path to where you wish your database file to reside. It is
strongly suggested that you choose a path that is outside of the webroot, yet
ensure that the directory is writeable by the web server.

If you must place your database file in your webroot, you could try using the
following in your "Database file" field:

  sites/default/files/.ht.sqlite

Note: The .ht in the name will tell Apache to prevent the database from being
downloaded. Please check that the file is, indeed, protected by your webserver.
If not, please consult the documentation of your webserver on how to protect a
file from downloading.
