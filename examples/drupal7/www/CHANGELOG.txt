  will no longer get an error message saying "An Ajax HTTP request terminated
  abnormally".
- The system_region_list() API function now takes an optional third parameter
  which allows region name translations to be skipped when they are not needed
  (API addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2810365).
- Numerous performance improvements.
- Numerous bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.50, 2016-07-07 
-----------------------
- Added a new "administer fields" permission for trusted users, which is
  required in addition to other permissions to use the field UI
  (https://www.drupal.org/node/2483307).
- Added clickjacking protection to Drupal core by setting the X-Frame-Options
  header to SAMEORIGIN by default (https://www.drupal.org/node/2735873).
- Added support for full UTF-8 (emojis, Asian symbols, mathematical symbols) on
  MySQL and other database drivers when the site and database are configured to
  allow it (https://www.drupal.org/node/2761183).
- Improved performance by avoiding a re-scan of directories when a file is
  missing; instead, trigger a PHP warning (minor API change:
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2581445).
- Made it possible to use any PHP callable in Ajax form callbacks, form API
  form-building functions, and form API wrapper callbacks (API addition:
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2761169).
- Fixed that following a password reset link while logged in leaves users unable
  to change their password (minor user interface change:
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2759023).
- Implemented various fixes for automated test failures on PHP 5.4+ and PHP 7.
  Drupal core automated tests now pass in these environments.
- Improved support for PHP 7 by fixing various problems.
- Fixed various bugs with PHP 5.5+ imagerotate(), including when incorrect
  color indices are passed in.
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.43 that allowed files uploaded by
  anonymous users to be lost after form validation errors, and that also caused
  regressions with certain contributed modules.
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.36 which caused the default value
  of hidden textarea fields to be ignored.
- Fixed robots.txt to allow search engines to access CSS, JavaScript and image
  files.
- Changed wording on the Update Manager settings page to clarify that the
  option to check for disabled module updates also applies to uninstalled
  modules (administrative-facing translatable string change).
- Changed the help text when editing menu links and configuring URL redirect
  actions so that it does not reference "Drupal" or the drupal.org website
  (administrative-facing translatable string change).
- Fixed the locale safety check that is used to ensure that translations are
  safe to allow for tokens in the href/src attributes of translated strings.
- Fixed that URL generation only works on port 80 when using domain based
  language negotation.
- Made method="get" forms work inside the administrative overlay. The fix adds
  a new hidden field to these forms when they appear inside the overlay (minor
  data structure change).
- Increased maxlength of menu link title input fields in the node form and
  menu link form from 128 to 255 characters.
- Removed meaningless post-check=0 and pre-check=0 cache control headers from

  values.
- Changed the {history} table's node ID field to be an unsigned integer, to
  match the same field in the {node} table and to prevent errors with very
  large node IDs.
- Added an explicit page callback to the "admin/people/create" menu item in the
  User module (minor data structure change). Previously this automatically
  inherited the page callback from the parent "admin/people" menu item, which
  broke contributed modules that override the "admin/people" page.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.44, 2016-06-15
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (privilege escalation). See SA-CORE-2016-002.

Drupal 7.43, 2016-02-24
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2016-001.

Drupal 7.42, 2016-02-03
-----------------------
- Stopped invoking hook_flush_caches() on every cron run, since some modules
  use that hook for expensive operations that are only needed on cache clears.
- Changed the default .htaccess and web.config to block Composer-related files.
- Added static caching to module_load_include() to improve performance.
- Fixed double-encoding bugs in select field widgets provided by the Options
  module. The fix deprecates the 'strip_tags' property on option widgets and
  replaces it with a new 'strip_tags_and_unescape' property (minor data
  structure change).
- Improved MySQL 5.7 support by changing the MySQL database driver to stop
  using the ANSI SQL mode alias, which has different meanings for different
  MySQL versions.
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.39 which prevented autocomplete
  functionality from working on servers that are not configured to
  automatically recognize index.php.
- Updated the Archive_Tar PEAR package to the latest 1.4.0 release, to fix bugs
  with tar file handling on various operating systems.
- Fixed fatal errors on node preview when a field is displayed in the node
  teaser but hidden in the full node view. The fix removes a
  field_attach_prepare_view() call from the node_preview() function since it is
  redundant with one in the node preview theme layer.
- Improved the description of the "Trimmed" format option on text fields
  (translatable string change, and minor UI and data structure change).
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.41, 2015-10-21
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (open redirect). See SA-CORE-2015-004.

Drupal 7.40, 2015-10-14
-----------------------
- Made Drupal's code for parsing .info files run much faster and use much less
  memory.

  201 through 206 HTTP status code.
- Added support for autoloading traits via the registry on sites running PHP
  5.4 or higher.
- Allowed the user-picture.tpl.php theme template to have HTML classes besides
  the default "user-picture" class printed in it (markup change).
- Fixed the URL text filter to convert e-mail addresses with plus signs into
  mailto: links.
- Added alternate text to file icons displayed by the File module, to improve
  accessibility (string change, and minor API addition to theme_file_icon()).
- Changed one-time login link failure messages to be displayed as errors or
  warnings as appropriate, rather than as regular status messages (minor UI
  change and data structure change).
- Changed the default settings.php configuration to exclude private files from
  the "404_fast_paths" behavior.
- Changed the page that displays filter tips for a particular text format, for
  example filter/tips/full_html, to return "page not found" or "access denied"
  if the format does not exist or the user does not have access to it. This
  change adds a new menu item to the Filter module's hook_menu() entry (minor
  data structure change).
- Added a new hook, hook_block_cid_parts_alter(), to allow modules to alter the
  cache keys used for caching a particular block.
- Made drupal_set_message() display and return messages when "0" is passed in
  as the message to set.
- Fixed non-functional "Files displayed by default" setting on file fields.
- The "worker callback" provided in hook_cron_queue_info() and the "finished"
  callback specified during batch processing can now be any PHP callable
  instead of just functions.
- Prevented drupal_set_time_limit() from decreasing the time limit in the case
  where the PHP maximum execution time is already unlimited.
- Changed the default thousand marker for numeric fields from a space ("1 000")
  to nothing ("1000") (minor UI change: https://www.drupal.org/node/1388376).
- Prevented malformed theme .info files (without a "name" key) from causing
  exceptions during menu rebuilds. If an .info file without a "name" key is
  found in a module or theme directory, Drupal will now use the module or
  theme's machine name as the display name instead.
- Made the format column in the {date_format_locale} database table
  case-sensitive, to match the equivalent column in the {date_formats} table.
- Fixed a bug in the Statistics module that caused JavaScript files attached to
  a node while it is being viewed to be omitted from the page.
- Added an optional 'project:' prefix that can be added to dependencies in a
  module's .info file to indicate which project the dependency resides in (API
  addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2299747).
- Fixed various bugs that occurred after hooks were invoked early in the Drupal
  bootstrap and that caused module_implements() and drupal_alter() to cache an
  incomplete set of hook implementations for later use.
- Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff" when possible, to prevent
  certain web browsers from picking an unsafe MIME type.
- Prevented the database API from executing multiple queries at once on MySQL,
  if the site's PHP version is new enough to do so. This is a secondary defense
  against SQL injection (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2463973).
- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused the upgrade
  to fail when there were multiple file records pointing to the same file.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.39, 2015-08-19
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-003.

-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-002.

Drupal 7.37, 2015-05-07
-----------------------
- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.36 which caused certain kinds of content types
  to become disabled if they were defined by a no-longer-enabled module.
- Removed a confusing description regarding automatic time zone detection from
  the user account form (minor UI and data structure change).
- Allowed custom HTML tags with a dash in the name to pass through filter_xss()
  when specified in the list of allowed tags.
- Allowed hook_field_schema() implementations to specify indexes for fields
  based on a fixed-length column prefix (rather than the entire column), as was
  already allowed in hook_schema() implementations.
- Fixed PDO exceptions on PostgreSQL when accessing invalid entity URLs.
- Added a sites/all/libraries folder to the codebase, with instructions for
  using it.
- Added a description to the "Administer text formats and filters" permission
  on the Permissions page (string change).
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.36, 2015-04-01
-----------------------
- Added a 'file_public_schema' variable which allows modules that define
  publicly-accessible streams in hook_stream_wrappers() to bypass file download
  access checks when processing managed file upload fields.
- Fixed a bug that caused database query tags not to be added to search-related
  database queries under many circumstances, and which prevented the
  corresponding hook_query_TAG_alter() implementations from being called.
- Fixed the "for" attribute on managed file upload field labels to improve
  accessibility (minor markup change).
- Added a 'javascript_always_use_jquery' variable which can be set to FALSE by
  sites that may not need jQuery loaded on all pages, and a 'requires_jquery'
  option to drupal_add_js() which modules can set to FALSE when adding
  JavaScript files that have no dependency on jQuery (API addition:
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462717).
- Fixed incorrect foreign keys in the User module's role_permission and
  users_roles database tables.
- Changed permission descriptions throughout Drupal core to consistently link
  to relevant administrative pages, regardless of whether the user viewing the
  Permissions page can view the page being linked to (minor UI change).
- Fixed the drupal_add_region_content() function so that it actually adds
  content to the page.
- Added an 'image_suppress_itok_output' variable to allow sites already using
  the existing 'image_allow_insecure_derivatives' variable to also prevent
  security tokens from appearing in image derivative URLs.
- Fixed double-escaping of theme names in the Block module administrative
  interface (minor string change).
- Added basic support for Xdebug when running automated tests.
- Fixed a bug which caused previewing a node to remove elements from the node
  being edited. With this fix, calling node_preview() will no longer modify the
  passed-in node object (minor API change).
- Added a user_has_role() function to check whether a user has a particular
  role (API addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2462411).
- Fixed installation failures when an opcode cache is enabled.
- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused private
  files to be inaccessible.
- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused user
  pictures to be lost.
- Fixed missing language code in hook_field_attach_view_alter() when it is
  invoked from field_view_field().
- Stopped sending ETag and Last-Modified headers for uncached page requests,
  since they break caching for certain Varnish and Nginx configurations.
- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-4 test classes to be used in
  Drupal 7.
- Fixed a fatal error that occurred when using the Comment module's "Unpublish
  comment containing keyword(s)" action.
- Changed the "lang" attribute on language links to "xml:lang" so it validates
  as XHTML (minor markup change).
- Prevented the form API from allowing arrays to be submitted for various form
  elements, such as textfields, textareas, and password fields (API change:
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462723).
- Fixed a bug in the Contact module which caused the global user object to have
  the incorrect name and e-mail address during the remainder of the page
  request after the contact form is submitted.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.35, 2015-03-18
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-001.

Drupal 7.34, 2014-11-19
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-006.

Drupal 7.33, 2014-11-07
-----------------------
- Began storing the file modification time of each module and theme in the
  {system} database table so that contributed modules can use it to identify
  recently changed modules and themes (minor data structure change to the
  return value of system_get_info() and other related functions).
- Added a "Did you mean?" feature to the run-tests.sh script for running
  automated tests from the command line, to help developers who are attempting
  to run a particular test class or group.
- Changed the date format used in various HTTP headers output by Drupal core
  from RFC 1123 format to RFC 7231 format.
- Added a "block_cache_bypass_node_grants" variable to allow sites which have
  node access modules enabled to use the block cache if desired (API addition).
- Made image derivative generation HTTP requests return a 404 error (rather
  than a 500 error) when the source image does not exist.
- Fixed a bug which caused user pictures to be removed from the user object
  after saving, and resulted in data loss if the user account was subsequently
  re-saved.
- Fixed a bug in which field_has_data() did not return TRUE for fields that
  only had data in older entity revisions, leading to loss of the field's data
  when the field configuration was edited.
- Fixed a bug which caused the Ajax progress throbber to appear misaligned in
  many situatons (minor styling change).
- Prevented the Bartik theme from lower-casing the "Permalink" link on
  comments, for improved multilingual support (minor UI change).
- Added a "preferred_menu_links" tag to the database query that is used by
  menu_link_get_preferred() to find the preferred menu link for a given path,
  to make it easier to alter.
- Increased the maximum allowed length of block titles to 255 characters
  (database schema change to the {block} table).
- Removed the Field module's field_modules_uninstalled() function, since it did
  not do anything when it was invoked.
- Added a "theme_hook_original" variable to templates and theme functions and
  an optional sitewide theme debug mode, to provide contextual information in
  the page's HTML to theme developers. The theme debug mode is based on the one
  used with Twig in Drupal 8 and can be accessed by setting the "theme_debug"
  variable to TRUE (API addition).
- Added an entity_view_mode_prepare() API function to allow entity-defining
  modules to properly invoke hook_entity_view_mode_alter(), and used it
  throughout Drupal core to fix bugs with the invocation of that hook (API
  change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2369141).
- Security improvement: Made the database API's orderBy() method sanitize the
  sort direction ("ASC" or "DESC") for queries built with db_select(), so that
  calling code does not have to.
- Changed the RDF module to consistently output RDF metadata for nodes and
  comments near where the node is rendered in the HTML (minor markup and data
  structure change).
- Added an HTML class to RDFa metatags throughout Drupal to prevent them from
  accidentally affecting the site appearance (minor markup change).
- Fixed a bug in the Unicode requirements check which prevented installing
  Drupal on PHP 5.6.
- Fixed a bug which caused drupal_get_bootstrap_phase() to abort the bootstrap
  when called early in the page request.
- Renamed the "Search result" view mode to "Search result highlighting input"
  to better reflect how it is used (UI change).
- Improved database queries generated by EntityFieldQuery in the case where
  delta or language condition groups are used, to reduce the number of INNER
  JOINs (this is a minor data structure change affecting code which implements
  hook_query_alter() on these queries).
- Removed special-case behavior for file uploads which allowed user #1 to
  bypass maximum file size and user quota limits.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.32, 2014-10-15
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (SQL injection). See SA-CORE-2014-005.

Drupal 7.31, 2014-08-06
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (denial of service). See SA-CORE-2014-004.

Drupal 7.30, 2014-07-24
-----------------------
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.29 that caused files or images
  attached to taxonomy terms to be deleted when the taxonomy term was edited
  and resaved (and other related bugs with contributed and custom modules).
- Added a warning on the permissions page to recommend restricting access to
  the "View site reports" permission to trusted administrators. See
  DRUPAL-PSA-2014-002.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.29, 2014-07-16
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-003.

Drupal 7.28, 2014-05-08
-----------------------
- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.27 that caused JavaScript to break
  on older browsers (such as Internet Explorer 8 and earlier) when Ajax was
  used.
- Increased the timeout used by the Update Manager module when it fetches data
  from drupal.org (from 5 seconds to 30 seconds), to work around a problem
  which causes incomplete information about security updates to be presented to
  site administrators. This fix may lead to a performance slowdown on the
  Update Manager administration pages, when installing Drupal distributions,
  and (for sites that use the automated cron feature) on occasional page loads
  by site visitors.
- Fixed the behavior of the token system's "[node:summary]" token when the body
  field does not have a manual summary.
- Changed the behavior of db_query_temporary() so that it works on SELECT
  queries even when they have leading comments/whitespace. A side effect of
  this fix is that db_query_temporary() will now fail with an error if it is
  ever used on non-SELECT queries.
- Added a "node_admin_filter" tag to the database query used to build the list
  of nodes on the content administration page, to make it easier to alter.
- Made the cron queue system log any exceptions that are thrown while an item
  in the queue is being processed, rather than stopping the entire PHP request.
- Improved screen reader support by adding an aria-live HTML attribute to file
  upload fields when there is an error uploading the file (minor markup
  change).
- Made the pager on the Tracker module listing pages show the same number of
  items as other pagers throughout Drupal core (minor UI change).
- Fixed a bug which caused caches not to be properly cleared when a file entity
  was saved or deleted.
- Added several missing countries to the default list returned by
  country_get_list() (string change).
- Replaced the term "weight" with "influence" in the content ranking settings
  for search, and added help text for administrators (string change).
- Fixed untranslatable text strings in the administrative interface for the
  "Crop" effect provided by the Image module (minor string change).
- Fixed a bug in the Taxonomy module update function introduced in Drupal 7.26
  that caused memory and CPU problems on sites with very large numbers of
  unpublished nodes.
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.27, 2014-04-16
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (information disclosure). See SA-CORE-2014-002.

Drupal 7.26, 2014-01-15
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-001.

Drupal 7.25, 2014-01-02
-----------------------
- Fixed a bug in node_save() which prevented the saved node from being updated
  in hook_node_insert() and other similar hooks.
- Added a meta tag to install.php to prevent it from being indexed by search
  engines even when Drupal is installed in a subfolder (minor markup change).
- Fixed a bug in the database API that caused frequent deadlock errors when
  running merge queries on some servers.
- Performance improvement: Prevented block rehashing from writing blocks to the
  database on every cache clear and cron run when the blocks have not changed.
  This fix results in an extra 'saved' key which is added and set to TRUE for
  each block returned by _block_rehash() that actually is saved to the database
  (data structure change).
- Added an optional 'skip on cron' parameter to hook_cron_queue_info() to allow
  queues to avoid being automatically processed on cron runs (API addition).
- Fixed a bug which caused hook_block_view_MODULE_DELTA_alter() to never be
  invoked if the block delta had a hyphen in it. To implement the hook when the
  block delta has a hyphen, modules should now replace hyphens with underscores
  when constructing the function name for the hook implementation.
- Fixed a bug which caused cached pages to sometimes be sent to the browser
  with incorrect compression. The fix adds a new 'page_compressed' key to the
  $cache->data array returned by drupal_page_get_cache() (minor data structure
  change).
- Fixed broken tests on PHP 5.5.
- Made the File and Image modules more robust when saving entities that have
  deleted files attached. The code in file_field_presave() will now remove the
  record of the deleted file from the entity before saving (minor data
  structure change).
- Standardized menu callback functions throughout Drupal core to return
  MENU_NOT_FOUND and MENU_ACCESS_DENIED rather than printing their own "page
  not found" or "access denied" pages (minor API change in the return value of
  these functions under some circumstances).
- Fixed a bug in which caches were not properly cleared when a node was deleted
  via the administrative interface.
- Changed the Bartik theme to render content contained in <pre>, <code> and
  similar tags in a larger font size, so it is easier to read.
- Fixed a bug in the Search module that caused exceptions to be thrown during
  searches if the server was not configured to represent decimal points as a
  period.
- Fixed a regression in the Image module that made image_style_url() not work
  when a relative path (rather than a complete file URI) was passed to it.
- Added an optional feature to the Statistics module to allow node views to be
  tracked by Ajax requests rather than during the server-side generation of the
  page. This allows the node counter to work on sites that use external page
  caches (string change and new administrative option:
  https://drupal.org/node/2164069).
- Added a link to the drupal.org documentation page for cron to the Cron
  settings page (string change).
- Added a 'drupal_anonymous_user_object' variable to allow the anonymous user
  object returned by drupal_anonymous_user() to be overridden with a classed
  object (API addition).
- Changed the database API to allow inserts based on a SELECT * query to work
  correctly.
- Changed the database schema of the {file_managed} table to allow Drupal to
  manage files larger than 4 GB.
- Changed the File module's hook_field_load() implementation to prevent file
  entity properties which have the same name as file or image field properties
  from overwriting the field properties (minor API change).
- Numerous small bug fixes.
- Numerous API documentation improvements.
- Additional automated test coverage.

Drupal 7.24, 2013-11-20
-----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2013-003.

Drupal 7.23, 2013-08-07
-----------------------
- Fixed a fatal error on PostgreSQL databases when updating the Taxonomy module
  from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7.
- Fixed the default ordering of CSS files for sites using right-to-left
  languages, to consistently place the right-to-left override file immediately
  after the CSS it is overriding (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058463).
- Added a drupal_check_memory_limit() API function to allow the memory limit to
  be checked consistently (API addition).
- Changed the default web.config file for IIS servers to allow favicon.ico
  files which are present in the filesystem to be accessed.
- Fixed inconsistent support for the 'tel' protocol in Drupal's URL filtering
  functions.
- Performance improvement: Allowed all hooks to be included in the
  module_implements() cache, even those that are only invoked on HTTP POST
  requests.
- Made the database system replace truncate queries with delete queries when
  inside a transaction, to fix issues with PostgreSQL and other databases.
- Fixed a bug which caused nested contextual links to display improperly.
- Fixed a bug which prevented cached image derivatives from being flushed for
  private files and other non-default file schemes.
- Fixed drupal_render() to always return an empty string when there is no
  output, rather than sometimes returning NULL (minor API change).
- Added protection to cache_clear_all() to ensure that non-cache tables cannot
  be truncated (API addition: a new isValidBin() method has been added to the
  default database cache implementation).
- Changed the default .htaccess file to support HTTP authorization in CGI
  environments.
- Changed the password reset form to pre-fill the username when requested via a
  URL query parameter, and used this in the error message that appears after a
  failed login attempt (minor data structure and behavior change).

  behavior is now changed so that if more than one module tries to set the same
  parameter, the last module's change takes effect.
- Fixed a serious documentation bug: The $name variable in the
  taxonomy-term.tpl.php theme template was incorrectly documented as being
  sanitized when in fact it is not.

- Allowed aggregator feed items to have URLs longer than 255 characters
  (schema change which results in several columns in the Aggregator module's
  database tables changing from VARCHAR to TEXT fields).

- Modified the Update manager module to allow drupal.org to collect usage
  statistics for individual modules and themes, rather than only for entire
  projects.
- Modified the node listing database query on Drupal's default front page to
  add table aliases for better query altering (this is a data structure change
  affecting code which implements hook_query_alter() on this query).

  language property in hook_entity_info(), and modules working with entities
  may access the language using entity_language() (API change:
  http://drupal.org/node/1626346).
- Added EntityFieldQuery support for taxonomy bundles.
- Fixed issue where field form structure was incomplete if field_access()
  returned FALSE. Instead of being incomplete, the form structure now has
  #access set to FALSE and field form validation is skipped (data structure
  change: http://drupal.org/node/1663020).
- Fixed data loss issue due to field_has_data() returning inconsistent results.
  The fix adds an optional DANGEROUS_ACCESS_CHECK_OPT_OUT tag to entity field
  queries which field storage engines can respond to (API addition:
  http://drupal.org/node/1597378).

----------------------
- Fixed security issues (Cross site scripting, File access bypass), see SA-CORE-2011-001.

Drupal 7.0, 2011-01-05 
----------------------
- Database:
    * Fully rewritten database layer utilizing PHP 5's PDO abstraction layer.
    * Drupal now requires MySQL >= 5.0.15 or PostgreSQL >= 8.3.
    * Added query builders for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and SELECT queries.
    * Support for master/slave replication, transactions, multi-insert queries,
      and other features.
    * Added support for the SQLite database engine.
    * Default to InnoDB engine, rather than MyISAM, on MySQL when available.
      This offers increased scalability and data integrity.
- Security:
    * Protected cron.php -- cron will only run if the proper key is provided.
    * Implemented a pluggable password system and much stronger password hashes
      that are compatible with the Portable PHP password hashing framework.
    * Rate limited login attempts to prevent brute-force password guessing, and
      improved the flood control API to allow variable time windows and
      identifiers for limiting user access to resources.
    * Transformed the "Update status" module into the "Update manager" which
      can securely install or update modules and themes via a web interface.
- Usability:
    * Added contextual links (a.k.a. local tasks) to page elements, such as
      blocks, nodes, or comments, which allows to perform the most common tasks
      with a single click only.
    * Improved installer requirements check.
    * Improved support for integration of WYSIWYG editors.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for input format listings.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for language listing.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for poll options.
    * Provided descriptions and human-readable names for user permissions.
    * Removed comment controls for users.
    * Removed display order settings for comment module. Comment display
      order can now be customized using the Views module.
    * Removed the 'related terms' feature from taxonomy module since this can
      now be achieved with Field API.
    * Added additional features to the default installation profile, and
      implemented a "slimmed down" profile designed for developers.
    * Added a built-in, automated cron run feature, which is triggered by site
      visitors.
    * Added an administrator role which is assigned all permissions for
      installed modules automatically.
    * Image toolkits are now provided by modules (rather than requiring a
      manual file copy to the includes directory).
    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names, e.g. Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain e-mail
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now login with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is powered
      by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (http://drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      http://drupal.org/project/chameleon and http://drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been
      preserved but renamed to file_unmanaged_*().
    * Rewrote file handling to use PHP stream wrappers to enable support for
      both public and private files and to support pluggable storage mechanisms
      and access to remote resources (e.g. S3 storage or Flickr photos).
    * The mime_extension_mapping variable has been removed. Modules that need to
      alter the default MIME type extension mappings should implement
      hook_file_mimetype_mapping_alter().
    * Added the hook_file_url_alter() hook, which makes it possible to serve
      files from a CDN.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading files, previously provided by
      the contributed module FileField.
- Image handling:
    * Improved image handling, including better support for add-on image
      libraries.

    * Added support for RDFa export of nodes, comments, terms, users, etc. and
      their fields.
- Search engine optimization and web linking:
    * Added a rel="canonical" link on node and comment pages to prevent
      duplicate content indexing by search engines.
    * Added a default rel="shortlink" link on node and comment pages that
      advertises a short link as an alternative URL to third-party services.
    * Meta information is now alterable by all modules before rendering.
- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.
    * Node bodies and teasers are now Field API fields instead of
      being a hard-coded property of node objects.
    * In addition, any other object type may register with Field API
      and allow custom data fields to be attached to itself.
    * Provides most of the features of the former Content Construction
      Kit (CCK) module.
    * Taxonomy terms are now Field API fields that can be added to any fieldable
      object.
- Installer:
    * Refactored the installer into an API that allows Drupal to be installed
      via a command line script.
- Page organization
    * Made the help text area a full featured region with blocks.
    * Site mission is replaced with the highlighted content block region and
      separate RSS feed description settings.
    * The footer message setting was removed in favor of custom blocks.
    * Made the main page content a block which can be moved and ordered
      with other blocks in the same region.
    * Blocks can now return structured arrays for later rendering just
      like page callbacks.
- Translation system
    * The translation system now supports message context (msgctxt).
    * Added support for translatable fields to Field API.
- JavaScript changes
    * Upgraded the core JavaScript library to jQuery version 1.4.4.
    * Upgraded the jQuery Forms library to 2.52.
    * Added jQuery UI 1.8.7, which allows improvements to Drupal's user
      experience.
- Better module version support
    * Modules now can specify which version of another module they depend on.
- Removed modules from core
    * The following modules have been removed from core, because contributed
      modules with similar functionality are available:
      * Blog API module
      * Ping module
      * Throttle module
- Improved node access control system.
    * All modules may now influence the access to a node at runtime, not just
      the module that defined a node.
    * Users may now be allowed to bypass node access restrictions without giving
      them complete access to the site.
    * Access control affects both published and unpublished nodes.
    * Numerous other improvements to the node access system.
- Actions system
    * Simplified definitions of actions and triggers.
    * Removed dependency on the combination of hooks and operations. Triggers
      now directly map to module hooks.
- Task handling
    * Added a queue API to process many or long-running tasks.
    * Added queue API support to cron API.
    * Added a locking framework to coordinate long-running operations across
      requests.

    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
