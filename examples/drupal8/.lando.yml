  # Optionally specify how you want Lando to handle Drush. There are a few options
  #
  # If omitted this will install the Drush Launcher and assume you've installed a
  # site-local version of Drush with Composer
  #
  # You can also configure it in the following ways:
  #
  # 1. Install via Composer
  #
  # This will install the Drush Launcher (https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher)
  # and will delegate to the site-local version of Drush you've installed with Composer
  # http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/
  # drush: composer
  #
  # 2. Install Globally
  #
  # This will globally install the corresponding Drush 8 PHAR posted over at
  # https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases
  # drush: global:8.1.12
  #
  # This will ATTEMPT to globally install any pre Drush 8 versions via Composer
  # drush: global:~7
  #
  # 3. Specify a path
  #
  # This assumes the user has already installed Drush but wishes to tell Lando where
  # it exists.
  # drush: path:/app/vendor/bin/drush
  #
  # 4. Do nothing
  #
  # This will tell Lando to not do anything, e.g. it's up to the user
  # drush: false
  #
  drush: composer

  # Optionally specify whether you want to disable the global install of drupal console.
  #
  # You should also consider a site-local install of drupal console via composer

  # drupal: false

  # a version with `type:version` but you will need to consult the documentation
  # for the correct DB service to see what versions are available
