/**

 * @{
 * Functions to enable the processing and display of HTML forms.
 *
 * Drupal uses these functions to achieve consistency in its form processing and
 * presentation, while simplifying code and reducing the amount of HTML that
 * must be explicitly generated by modules.
 *
 * The drupal_get_form() function handles retrieving, processing, and
 * displaying a rendered HTML form for modules automatically. For example:
 *
 * @code
 * // Display the user registration form.
 * $output = drupal_get_form('user_register');
 * @endcode
 *
 * Forms can also be built and submitted programmatically without any user input
 * using the drupal_execute() function.
 *
 * For information on the format of the structured arrays used to define forms,
 * and more detailed explanations of the Form API workflow, see the
 * @link forms_api_reference.html reference @endlink and the
 * @link http://drupal.org/node/204270 Form API guide. @endlink

/**
 * @defgroup batch Batch operations
 * @{
 * Functions allowing forms processing to be spread out over several page
 * requests, thus ensuring that the processing does not get interrupted
 * because of a PHP timeout, while allowing the user to receive feedback
 * on the progress of the ongoing operations.
 *
 * The API is primarily designed to integrate nicely with the Form API
 * workflow, but can also be used by non-FAPI scripts (like update.php)
 * or even simple page callbacks (which should probably be used sparingly).
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * $batch = array(
 *   'title' => t('Exporting'),
 *   'operations' => array(
 *     array('my_function_1', array($account->uid, 'story')),
 *     array('my_function_2', array()),
 *   ),
 *   'finished' => 'my_finished_callback',
 *   'file' => 'path_to_file_containing_myfunctions',
 * );
 * batch_set($batch);
 * // Only needed if not inside a form _submit handler.
 * // Setting redirect in batch_process.
 * batch_process('node/1');
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note: if the batch 'title', 'init_message', 'progress_message', or
 * 'error_message' could contain any user input, it is the responsibility of
 * the code calling batch_set() to sanitize them first with a function like
 * check_plain() or filter_xss().
 *
 * Sample batch operations:
 * @code
 * // Simple and artificial: load a node of a given type for a given user
 * function my_function_1($uid, $type, &$context) {
 *   // The $context array gathers batch context information about the execution (read),
 *   // as well as 'return values' for the current operation (write)
 *   // The following keys are provided :
 *   // 'results' (read / write): The array of results gathered so far by
 *   //   the batch processing, for the current operation to append its own.
 *   // 'message' (write): A text message displayed in the progress page.
 *   // The following keys allow for multi-step operations :
 *   // 'sandbox' (read / write): An array that can be freely used to
 *   //   store persistent data between iterations. It is recommended to
 *   //   use this instead of $_SESSION, which is unsafe if the user
 *   //   continues browsing in a separate window while the batch is processing.
 *   // 'finished' (write): A float number between 0 and 1 informing
 *   //   the processing engine of the completion level for the operation.
 *   //   1 (or no value explicitly set) means the operation is finished
 *   //   and the batch processing can continue to the next operation.
 *
 *   $node = node_load(array('uid' => $uid, 'type' => $type));
 *   $context['results'][] = $node->nid .' : '. $node->title;
 *   $context['message'] = $node->title;
 * }
 *
 * // More advanced example: multi-step operation - load all nodes, five by five
 * function my_function_2(&$context) {
 *   if (empty($context['sandbox'])) {
 *     $context['sandbox']['progress'] = 0;
 *     $context['sandbox']['current_node'] = 0;
 *     $context['sandbox']['max'] = db_result(db_query('SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nid) FROM {node}'));
 *   }
 *   $limit = 5;
 *   $result = db_query_range("SELECT nid FROM {node} WHERE nid > %d ORDER BY nid ASC", $context['sandbox']['current_node'], 0, $limit);
 *   while ($row = db_fetch_array($result)) {
 *     $node = node_load($row['nid'], NULL, TRUE);
 *     $context['results'][] = $node->nid .' : '. $node->title;
 *     $context['sandbox']['progress']++;
 *     $context['sandbox']['current_node'] = $node->nid;

/**
 * Opens a new batch.
 *
 * @param $batch
 *   An array defining the batch. The following keys can be used -- only
 *   'operations' is required, and batch_init() provides default values for
 *   the messages.
 *   - 'operations': Array of function calls to be performed.
 *     Example:
 *     @code
 *     array(
 *       array('my_function_1', array($arg1)),
 *       array('my_function_2', array($arg2_1, $arg2_2)),
 *     )
 *     @endcode
 *   - 'title': Title for the progress page. Only safe strings should be passed.
 *     Defaults to t('Processing').
 *   - 'init_message': Message displayed while the processing is initialized.
 *     Defaults to t('Initializing.').
 *   - 'progress_message': Message displayed while processing the batch.
 *     Available placeholders are @current, @remaining, @total, and
 *     @percentage. Defaults to t('Completed @current of @total.').
 *   - 'error_message': Message displayed if an error occurred while processing
 *     the batch. Defaults to t('An error has occurred.').
 *   - 'finished': Name of a function to be executed after the batch has
 *     completed. This should be used to perform any result massaging that
 *     may be needed, and possibly save data in $_SESSION for display after
 *     final page redirection.
 *   - 'file': Path to the file containing the definitions of the
 *     'operations' and 'finished' functions, for instance if they don't
 *     reside in the main .module file. The path should be relative to
 *     base_path(), and thus should be built using drupal_get_path().
 *
 * Operations are added as new batch sets. Batch sets are used to ensure
 * clean code independence, ensuring that several batches submitted by
 * different parts of the code (core / contrib modules) can be processed
 * correctly while not interfering or having to cope with each other. Each
 * batch set gets to specify its own UI messages, operates on its own set
 * of operations and results, and triggers its own 'finished' callback.
 * Batch sets are processed sequentially, with the progress bar starting
 * fresh for every new set.
