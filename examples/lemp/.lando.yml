# Give me http://lemp.lndo.site and https://lemp.lndo.site
proxy:
  nginx:
    - lemp.lndo.site

# Spin up services to run a basic LEMP stack
services:

  # Create a php 7.1 instance served by the latest nginx with https turned on and
  # served from the www subdirectory
  appserver:

    # PHP version .1
    type: php:7.1

    # Served by the latest nginx
    via: nginx

    # Optionally serve php over https
    ssl: true

    # Optionally specify a webroot if it is a subdirectory of the appRoot
    webroot: www

    # Optionally activate xdebug
    #
    # If you are having trouble getting xdebug to work please see:
    # https://docs.devwithlando.io/services/php.html#using-xdebug
    xdebug: true

    # Optionally customize the configuration for php and its underlying webserver
    # These paths are both relative to (and must reside within) the app root directory
    #
    # For some examples that use this fairly well please check out

    # Optionally install the following composer dependencies globally
    # These follow the normal composer.json form
