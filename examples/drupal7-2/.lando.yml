# Drupal 7 recipe
name: d7

# Start with the default Drupal 7 recipe
recipe: drupal7

# Configure the Drupal 7 recipe
config:

  # See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements

  # Optionally specify the php version to use.
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest php version supported by Drupal 7.
  # Consult the `php` service to see what versions are available. Note that all
  # such versions may not be supported in Drupal 7 so YMMV.
  #
  # See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/php
  #
  # NOTE: that this needs to be wrapped in quotes so that it is a string
  #
  php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve drupal via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  #
  # See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/web-server
  #
  via: nginx

  # Optionally specify the location of the webroot relative to your approot.
  #
  # If ommitted this will be your approot itself.
  #
  webroot: web

  # Optionally specify the version of Drush you want for your site
  #
  # If omitted (which is recommended) this will use the stable Drush
  #
  # This will take any version to which there is a corresponding phar over on
  # the drush github release page eg `drush: 8.1.12`
  #
  # see: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releasess
  #
  # Alternatively this will also take any supported composer version eg `~7`
  # THIS SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.
  #
  # Obviously, if you have a site-local drush installed via composer that will be
  # used instead of this one.
  #
  # see: http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/
  #
  # drush: stable

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:
  #
  #   - `mysql`
  #   - `mariadb`
  #   - `postgres`
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest mysql. You can additionally provide
  # a version with `type:version` but you will need to consult the documentation
  # for the correct DB service to see what versions are available
  #
  # see: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/database-server
  #
  database: mariadb:10.1

  # Optionally activate xdebug
  #
  # If you are having trouble getting xdebug to work please see:
  # https://docs.devwithlando.io/services/php.html#using-xdebug
  xdebug: true

  # Optionally mix in your own config files
  #
  # If ommitted this will use "sane defaults" for your recipe type
