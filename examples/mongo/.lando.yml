# Mongo example
name: mongo

# Give me http://mongo.lndo.site
proxy:
  appserver:
    - mongo.lndo.site

# Spin up a basic nodes server with mongo backend
services:

  # Spin up a mongo container called "database"
  # NOTE: "database" is arbitrary, you could just as well call this "thing" or "stuff"
  database:

    # Use latest stable version of mongo
    type: mongo

    # Optionally allow access to the database at localhost:27018
    # You will need to make sure port 27018 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 27018

    # Optionally use the following mongo config file
    # This is relative to the app root
    config: config.yml

  # Spin up services to run a basic node server
  appserver:
    type: node:6.10
    command: npm start
    globals:
      gulp-cli: "latest"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:
  npm:
    service: appserver
  gulp:
    service: appserver
  node:
    service: appserver
  # Add a route to the mongo shell
  mongo:
    service: database
