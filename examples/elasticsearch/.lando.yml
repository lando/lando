  # Spin up a memcache container called "search"
  # NOTE: "search" is arbitrary, you could just as well call this "theboss" or "eljefe"
  search:

    # Use version 5.4 of elasticsearch
    type: elasticsearch:5.4

    # Optionally allow access to the cache at localhost:9999
    # You will need to make sure port 9999 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 9999

    # Optionally load in a custom config file. This is relative to the app root.
    #
    # config: customElasticsearch.yml

    # There are various envvars you can specify to further customize how
    # elasticsearch works.
