Backdrop is a full-featured content management system that allows non-technical
users to manage a wide variety of content. It can be used to create all kinds of
websites including blogs, image galleries, social networks, intranets, and more.

Backdrop aims to provide:
- A CMS that can be used out-of-the-box.
- Code that can be learned quickly.
- Extensible APIs.

Requirements
------------
- PHP 5.3.2 or higher
- MySQL 5.0.15 or higher with PDO enabled
- Apache (recommended) or Nginx web server
- 50 MB of disk space (recommended), 15 MB (minimum)

Installation
------------

1. Create a new database, username, and password for Backdrop to use in MySQL.

2. Point your browser at the URL of your Backdrop installation. You will be
   redirected to the install screen. If you're not redirected, visit the install
   URL. If Backdrop was installed at http://example.com/backdrop, the install
   URL would be http://example.com/backdrop/core/install.php.

3. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
--------------------------------
Please use the GitHub
[issue tracker](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues) for
reporting all bugs and features. We use a separate issue tracker that is not
part of the main Backdrop code repository because of GitHub's restrictions on
the use of labels and issue management.

Security Issues
---------------
If you have discovered a security issue with Backdrop CMS or any of its
[contributed modules](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/), please contact the
Backdrop Security Team directly at [security@backdropcms.org](mailto:security@backdropcms.org).
We manage security issues separately in a private repository until the issue
has been resolved. Even if you're not sure if it's a security problem, please
contact the security team before filing an issue.
