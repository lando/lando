 * Available variables:
 * - $author: Comment author. Can be link or plain text.
 * - $content: An array of comment items. Use render($content) to print them

 *   hide($content['field_example']) to temporarily suppress the printing of a
 *   given element.
 * - $created: Formatted date and time for when the comment was created.
 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the $comment->created variable.
 * - $changed: Formatted date and time for when the comment was last changed.
 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the $comment->changed variable.
 * - $new: New comment marker.
 * - $permalink: Comment permalink.
 * - $submitted: Submission information created from $author and $created during
 *   template_preprocess_comment().
 * - $user_picture: The comment author's picture from user-picture.tpl.php.
 * - $signature: Authors signature.
 * - $status: Comment status. Possible values are:
 *   comment-unpublished, comment-published or comment-preview.
 * - $title: Linked title.
 * - $classes: Array of classes that can be used to style contextually through
 *   CSS. The default values can be one or more of the following:
 *   - comment: The current template type, i.e., "theming hook".
 *   - comment-by-anonymous: Comment by an unregistered user.
 *   - comment-by-node-author: Comment by the author of the parent node.
 *   - comment-preview: When previewing a new or edited comment.
 *   The following applies only to viewers who are registered users:
 *   - comment-unpublished: An unpublished comment visible only to
 *     administrators.
 *   - comment-by-viewer: Comment by the user currently viewing the page.
 *   - comment-new: New comment since last the visit.
 * - $attributes: Array of additional HTML attributes that should be added to
 *   the wrapper element. Flatten with backdrop_attributes().
 * - $title_prefix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed in front of the main title tag that
 *   appears in the template.
 * - $title_suffix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in
 *   the template.
