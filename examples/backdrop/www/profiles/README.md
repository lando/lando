Installation profiles define additional steps that run after the base
installation provided by Backdrop core when Backdrop is first installed.

What to place in this directory?
--------------------------------

Place downloaded and custom installation profiles in this directory.

Installation profiles are generally provided as part of distributions, and only
have an effect during the installation phase of a Backdrop website. Installation
profiles do not have any effect on a preexisting website.

Download additional distributions
---------------------------------

Contributed distributions from the Backdrop community may be available at
https://github.com/backdrop-contrib.

Multisite configuration
-----------------------

In multisite configurations installation profiles found in this directory are
available to all sites during their initial site installation.
