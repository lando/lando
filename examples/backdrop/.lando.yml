  # Consult the `php` service to see what versions are available. Note that all
  # such versions may not be supported in Backdrop 6 so YMMV.
  #
  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements
  #
  # NOTE: that this needs to be wrapped in quotes so that it is a string
  #
  php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve Backdrop via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  #
  # See: https://backdropcms.org/requirements

  # This can be either
  #   - `stable`

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:

  database: mariadb

  # Optionally mix in your own config files

  # you are specifying the correct value for the config.

    # server: config/backdrop.conf

# The Backdrop recipe is super slick but we want to augment this recipe so we can
