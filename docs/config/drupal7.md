# Drupal 7

Drupal is a free and open source content management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal provides a backend framework for at least 2.3% of all web sites worldwide â€“ ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites.

Lando offers a configurable [recipe](./../config/recipes.md) for developing [Drupal 7](https://drupal.org/) apps.

[[toc]]

## Getting Started

Before you get started with this recipe, we assume that you have:

1. [Installed Lando](./../basics/installation.md) and gotten familiar with [its basics](./../basics/)
2. [Initialized](./../basics/init.md) a [Landofile](./../config/lando.md) for your codebase for use with this recipe
3. Read about the various [services](./../config/services.md), [tooling](./../config/tooling.md), [events](./../config/events.md), and [routing](./../config/proxy.md) Lando offers.

However, because you are a developer and developers never ever [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) you can also run the following commands to try out this recipe with a vanilla install of Drupal 7.

```bash
# Initialize a drupal7 recipe using the latest Drupal 7 version
lando init \
  --source remote \
  --remote-url https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-7.71.tar.gz \
  --remote-options="--strip-components 1" \
  --recipe drupal7 \
  --webroot . \
  --name my-first-drupal7-app

# Start it up
lando start

# List information about this app.
lando info
```

## Configuration

While Lando [recipes](./../config/recipes.md) set sane defaults, so they work out of the box, they are also [configurable](./../config/recipes.md#config).

Here are the configuration options, set to the default values, for this recipe's [Landofile](./../config/lando.md). If you are unsure about where this goes or what this means, we *highly recommend* scanning the [recipes documentation](./../config/recipes.md) to get a good handle on how the magicks work.

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  php: '7.2'
  composer_version: '2.0.7'
  via: apache:2.4
  webroot: .
  database: mysql:5.7
  drush: ^8
  xdebug: false
  config:
    database: SEE BELOW
    php: SEE BELOW
    server: SEE BELOW
    vhosts: SEE BELOW
```

Note that if the above config options are not enough, all Lando recipes can be further [extended and overridden](./../config/recipes.md#extending-and-overriding-recipes).

### Choosing a php version

You can set `php` to any version that is available in our [php service](./php.md). However, you should consult the [Drupal requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/php-requirements) to make sure that version is supported by Drupal 7 itself.

The [recipe config](./../config/recipes.md#config) to set the Drupal 7 recipe to use `php` version `7.0` is shown below:

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  php: '7.0'
```

### Choosing a composer version

You can set `composer_version` to any version that is available in our [php service](./php.md#installing-composer).

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  composer_version: '1.10.1'
```

### Choosing a web server

By default, this recipe will be served by the default version of our [apache](./apache.md) service but you can also switch this to use [`nginx`](./nginx.md). We *highly recommend* you check out both the [apache](./apache.md) and [nginx](./nginx.md) services before you change the default `via`.

#### With Apache (default)

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  via: apache
```

#### With nginx

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  via: nginx
```

### Choosing a database backend

By default, this recipe will use the default version of our [mysql](./mysql.md) service as the database backend, but you can also switch this to use [`mariadb`](./mariadb.md) or ['postgres'](./postgres.md) instead. Note that you can also specify a version *as long as it is a version available for use with Lando* for either `mysql`, `mariadb` or `postgres`.

If you are unsure about how to configure the `database`, we *highly recommend* you check out the [mysql](./mysql.md), [mariadb](./mariadb.md)and ['postgres'](./postgres.md) services before you change the default.

Also, note that like the configuration of the `php` version, you should consult the [Drupal 7 requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/database-server) to make sure the `database` and `version` you select is supported by Drupal 7 itself.

#### Using MySQL (default)

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  database: mysql
```

#### Using MariaDB

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  database: mariadb
```

#### Using Postgres

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  database: postgres
```

#### Using a custom version

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  database: postgres:9.6
```

### Using Drush

By default, our Drupal 7 recipe will globally install the [latest version of Drush 8](http://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install/) or the [latest version of Drush 7](http://docs.drush.org/en/7.x/install/) if you are using php 5.3. This means that you should be able to use `lando drush` out of the box.

That said you can configure this recipe to use any version of Drush to which there is a resolvable package available via `composer`. That means that the following are all valid.

### Use the latest version of Drush

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  drush: "*"
```

#### Use the latest version of Drush 7

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  drush: ^7
```

#### Use a specific version of Drush 8

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  drush: 8.1.15
```

#### Using a site-local Drush

While Lando will globally install Drush for you it is increasingly common and in some cases a straight-up best practice to [install a site-local Drush](https://www.drush.org/install/) by requiring it in your projects `composer.json` file.

Because of how Lando's [php service](./php.md) sets up its [`PATH`](./php.md#path-considerations) this means that if you have indeed installed Drush on your own via `composer` Lando will use yours over its own. Said more explicitly: **if you've required `drush` via `composer` in your application then this recipe will use your `drush` and not the one you've specified in this recipes config.**

If you are using a site-local Drush, it is also recommended to configure a [build step](./../config/services.md#build-steps) to automatically install Drush before your app starts up. This can prevent weird version mismatches and other issues if you are using Drush in other Lando automation like [events](./../config/events.md).

**Automatically composer install before my app starts**

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
services:
  appserver:
    build:
      - composer install
```

If you find that Lando is not using your `drush` as expected, which can happen if you've modified `composer` to install in a different directory than its normal `vendor` you can take advantage of Lando's [tooling overrides](./../config/tooling.md#overriding) and specify an absolute path to your Drush.

```yaml
tooling:
  drush:
    cmd: /path/to/my/drush
```

#### Default URL Setup

You may see `http://default` show up in many `drush` commands you run.

```bash
lando drush uli
// http://default/user/reset/1/1548025070/Px6PbLyJ_2laXqoDe6OukHXaX-cXExo4ErfrKbkqsE4/login
```

This happens because it is actually a difficult problem for Lando to 100% know the canonical URL or service that is serving your application. However, you can set up your environment so that commands like `lando drush uli` return the proper URL.

Create or edit the relevant `settings.php` file and add these lines. Note that you may need to specify a port depending on your Lando installation. You can run `lando info` to see if your URLs use explicit ports or not.

```php
$base_url = "http://mysite.lndo.site:PORT_IF_NEEDED"
```

#### Aliases

You can also use `drush` aliases with a command like `lando drush @sitealias cc all` by following the instructions below.

Make sure the alias file exists within the drush folder in your app. An example could be the files structure below:

```bash
|-- app
   |-- drush
      |-- yoursite.aliases.drushrc.php
```

For info on how to set up your alias, please refer to the following [link](https://www.drupal.org/node/1401522) or see this [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.aliases.yml).

Then configure the following [build step](./../config/services.md#build-steps) in your [Landofile](./../config/lando.md) and `lando rebuild`.

```yml
services:
  appserver:
    build:
      - mkdir -p ~/.drush/site-aliases
      - ln -sf /app/drush/yoursite.aliases.drushrc.php ~/.drush/site-aliases/yoursite.drushrc.php
```

#### Configuring your root directory

If you are using a webroot besides `.`, you will need to remember to `cd` into that directory and run `lando drush` from there. This is because many site-specific `drush` commands will only run correctly if you run `drush` from a directory that also contains a Drupal site.

If you are annoyed by having to `cd` into that directory every time you run a `drush` command, you can get around it by [overriding](./../config/tooling.md#overriding) the `drush` tooling command in your [Landofile](./../config/lando.md) so that Drush always runs from your `webroot`.

**Note that hard coding the `root` like this may have unforeseen and bad consequences for some `drush` commands such as `drush scr`.**

```yaml
tooling:
  drush:
    service: appserver
    cmd: drush --root=/app/PATH/TO/WEBROOT
```

### Using xdebug

This is just a passthrough option to the [xdebug setting](./php.md#toggling-xdebug) that exists on all our [php services](./php.md). The `tl;dr` is `xdebug: true` enables and configures the php xdebug extension and `xdebug: false` disables it.

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  xdebug: true|false
```

However, for more information we recommend you consult the [php service documentation](./php.md).


### Using custom config files

You may need to override our [default Drupal 7 config](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/plugins/lando-recipes/recipes/drupal7) with your own.

If you do this, you must use files that exist inside your application and express them relative to your project root as shown below:

Note that the default files may change based on how you set both `ssl` and `via`. Also note that the `vhosts` and `server` config will be either for `apache` or `nginx` depending on how you set `via`. We *highly recommend* you check out both the [apache](./apache.md#configuration) and [nginx](./nginx.md#configuration) if you plan to use a custom `vhosts` or `server` config.

**A hypothetical project**

Note that you can put your configuration files anywhere inside your application directory. We use a `config` directory in the below example but you can call it whatever you want such as `.lando`.

```bash
./
|-- config
   |-- default.conf
   |-- my-custom.cnf
   |-- php.ini
   |-- server.conf
|-- index.php
|-- .lando.yml
```

**Landofile using custom drupal7 config**

```yaml
recipe: drupal7
config:
  config:
    database: config/my-custom.cnf
    php: config/php.ini
    server: config/server.conf
    vhosts: config/default.conf
```

## Connecting to your database

Lando will automatically set up a database with a user and password and also set an environment variable called [`LANDO INFO`](./../guides/lando-info.md) that contains useful information about how your application can access other Lando services.

The default database connection information for a Drupal 7 site is shown below:

Note that the `host` is not `localhost` but `database`.

```yaml
database: drupal7
username: drupal7
password: drupal7
host: database
# for mysql
port: 3306
# for postgres
# username: postgres
# password: ''
# port: 5432
```

You can get also get the above information, and more, by using the [`lando info`](./../cli/info.md) command.

## Importing Your Database

Once you've started up your Drupal 7 site, you will need to pull in your database and files before you can really start to dev all the dev. Pulling your files is as easy as downloading an archive and extracting it to the correct location. Importing a database can be done using our helpful `lando db-import` command.

```bash
# Grab your database dump
curl -fsSL -o database.sql.gz "https://url.to.my.db/database.sql.gz"

# Import the database
# NOTE: db-import can handle uncompressed, gzipped or zipped files
# Due to restrictions in how Docker handles file sharing your database
# dump MUST exist somewhere inside of your app directory.
lando db-import database.sql.gz
```

You can learn more about the `db-import` command [over here](./../guides/db-import.md)

## Tooling

By default, each Lando Drupal 7 recipe will also ship with helpful dev utilities.

This means you can use things like `drush`, `composer` and `php` via Lando and avoid mucking up your actual computer trying to manage `php` versions and tooling.

```bash
lando composer          Runs Composer commands
lando db-export [file]  Exports database from a service into a file
lando db-import <file>  Imports a dump file into database service
lando drush             Runs Drush commands
lando mysql             Drops into a MySQL shell on a database service
lando php               Runs PHP commands
```

**Usage examples**

```bash
# Download a dependency with drush
lando drush dl views

# Run composer tests
lando composer test

# Drop into a mysql shell
lando mysql

# Check the app's installed php extensions
lando php -m
```

You can also run `lando` from inside your app directory for a complete list of commands. This is always advisable as your list of commands may not be 100% the same as above. For example, if you set `database: postgres` you will get `lando psql` instead of `lando mysql`.
