Windows is also running VirtualBox
==================================

In some cases you cannot use VirtualBox (a common development tool) with Hyper-V, however, there is a documented workaround you can check out over at [https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/](https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/).

> #### Quote::VirtualBox loses
>
> VirtualBox and Hyper-V cannot co-exist on the same machine. Only one hypervisor can run at a time, and since Hyper-V runs all the time, while VirtualBox only runs when it is launched, VirtualBox is the loser in this scenario.
