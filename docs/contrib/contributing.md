Overview
========

Lando is led by a [benevolent dictator](./roles.md#benevolent-dictator) and committee of [maintainers](./roles.md#maintainers) and managed by the community.

That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the maintainers. In case of disagreement, the benevolent dictator has the last word. It is the benevolent dictator’s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way.

In turn, it is the community’s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution.

Communication
-------------

Project collaboration happens primarily on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Slack](https://slack.com/).

#### GitHub

GitHub serves as the mechanism for all Lando code, issue reporting/tracking and project management.

The [Lando Organization](https://github.com/lando) is the starting point for all Lando projects. That said most collaboration is going to occur in the core [Lando Project](https://github.com/lando/lando) and its [issue queue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

It you are a contributor it is **highly recommended** you also install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to get access to a nice Kanban style board for the GitHub issues.

#### Slack

Slack serves as the mechanism for Lando support and contributor coordination. You can join the Lando slack org via [SlackPass](https://launchpass.com/kalabox) and it has the following channels you can join

  * **#kalabox** - For legacy Kalabox community support
  * **#lando** - For Lando community support
  * **#contributors** - For all Lando contributors
  * **#community** - For users looking to evangelize the project at meetups, events, camps, etc
