# Security

If you have discovered a security issue with Lando, please contact the Lando Security Team directly at [security@devwithlando.io](mailto:security@devwithlando.io). We manage security issues separately in a private repository until the issue has been resolved. Even if you're not sure if it's a security problem, please contact the security team before filing an issue, blogging or tweeting about it.
