Governance
==========

Governance of the project is simple and straightforward:

  * [Maintainers](./roles.md#maintainers) make consensus driven decisions about the project.
  * The [Benevolent Dictator](./roles.md#benevolent-dictator) has the final say on all decisions but generally only exercises this power on an as-needed basis, most usually when the maintainers cannot reach consensus.
