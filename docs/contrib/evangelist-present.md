# Presenting

The most obvious and straightforward way to evangelize is to present about Lando or Lando-adjacent things at a meetup, camp, conference, training or other gathering.

Some helpful steps to get you started are shown below:

## Finding an event

We recommend getting in touch with local event organizers to help you get started. It's also a good idea to [join our Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and check out the **#community** and/or **#evangelists** channels. There is likely another Lando evangelist who can help you out.

Some well known places to get you started are below:

* [Drupal Events Calendar](https://www.drupal.org/community/events)
* [WordPress Event Calendar](https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/)
* [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)

## Submitting a session, proposal or deck

Once you've found an event, the next step is usually to submit a session/proposal and/or start creating the content for your presentation, talk or training.

While you certainly can create content from scratch, we recommend you request access to this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ooK_NTMBuwOV0uix8O54umJGwAODL9dC) as it contains a large cache of previously submitted sessions, proposals, slide decks and training materials. It's highly likely you can fork or adapt some of these as a starting point.

We also highly encourage you to contribute your finished presentation materials back to the same Google folder. This both aids future evangelists and also serves as a record for posterity.

Before crafting your content, definitely check out the [talking points](./talking-points.md) so you hit on all the Lando goodness. If you want to see Lando keep winning, please insert a slide reminding people to [sponsor Lando](sponsor-intro.md)!
