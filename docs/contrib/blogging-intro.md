# Getting Started Blogging

Our blog is intended as a space for our Alliance members to post development related materials. While we prefer Lando related content its a space for _any_ dev content.

## What do I need to get started?

You will need to go through all the steps in our [Getting Involved](contributing) section if you have not done so already. This will get you rolling for contribution. Here are all the steps from the aforementioned section for completeness.

1. [Join the alliance](./join.md)
2. [Join the comms](./comms.md)
3. [Install Lando from source and activate secret toggle](./activate.md)
4. [Add yourself as a contributor](./first.md)
5. [Proceed to adding your first post](./blogging-add.md)

If you are having issues with any of the above or need some guidance from one of our guide pros make sure you [join our Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and check out the **#community** and/or **#guiders** channels.

## What should I write?

Here are some Lando and non-Lando ideas for content

* A case study showcasing how Lando saved time and money
* A comparison of development tools
* An article about how QBASIC is the future of dev

You can always check to see if there are any [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lando/lando/labels/guide) that have been tagged `blog post`.
