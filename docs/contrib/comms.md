# 2. Join

We recommend you join the mechanisms below.

## GitHub

GitHub serves as the mechanism for all Lando code, issue reporting/tracking and project management.

While the [Lando Organization](https://github.com/lando) serves as the starting point for all Lando projects, most collaboration is going to occur in the core [Lando Project](https://github.com/lando/lando) and its [issue queue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

If you are a contributor, it is **highly recommended** you also install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to get access to a nice Kanban style board for the GitHub issues.

## Slack

Slack serves as the mechanism for Lando support and contributor coordination. You can join the Lando slack org via [LaunchPass](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando). By default, you will be added to the **#community** channel which is our free and open community support channel. You can also join any of the additional channels as is appropriate below:

  * **#administrators** - For those who help administer and coordinate Lando
  * **#bloggers** - For those contributing case studies, training materials and other content to the blog
  * **#evangelists** - For those looking to evangelize Lando at meetups, events, camps, etc
  * **#guiders** - For those writing helpful Lando guides and tutorials
  * **#upsellers** - For those helping to help sell Lando sponsorships, support and services
  * **#contributors** - For those who contribute to the making of Lando
  * **#social** - For suggesting social content for Lando
  * **#kalabox** - For legacy Kalabox community support

Join some channels and say hi!
