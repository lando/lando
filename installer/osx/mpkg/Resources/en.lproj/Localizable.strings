If you are using the Stable version make sure you close Docker before continuing this installation as Lando will install the latest version.

If you wish to continue with your current version of Docker without upgrading make sure you customize your installation on the next step and choose to not install Docker.

Keeping your current version of Docker is not supported so YMMV.";
